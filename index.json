[{"content":"I recently wrote an integration test framework for a Kafka pipeline using Cucumber and Testcontainers. This is part 1 of a series explaining how, starting with setting up our project to be able to run Cucumber tests from maven \u0026amp; our IDE (IntelliJ in my case).\nwhy cucumber? I\u0026rsquo;d previously written a couple of integration test frameworks triggered from JUnit @Test methods. These both used fluent APIs to set up the required environment \u0026amp; execute the test, hiding the plumbing from the test author.\nThis worked well in a team where the developers wrote most of the tests. This time around and on a different project I wanted tests that could be maintained by less-technical folks and hopefully replace separate acceptance criteria in stories.\nI looked at a couple of BDD frameworks to achieve this and liked the look of Cucumber.\nfeatures and steps The key technical differences between writing a JUnit test and a Cucumber test (one implemented in Java at least) are that the tests are defined in feature files and use steps which are defined in a class file.\nThe feature file is written in Gherkin, a business-readable language for defining behaviour. It has a few keywords used to define the preconditions, stimulus \u0026amp; expected outcome of the test in a Given-When-Then format.\nThe example used in the 10min Cucumber tutorial looks a bit like this:\nFeature:Is it Friday yet? Everybody wants to know when it\u0026#39;s Friday Scenario:Sunday isn\u0026#39;t Friday Given today is Sunday When I ask whether it\u0026#39;s Friday yet Then I should be told \u0026#34;Nope\u0026#34; \u0026hellip; and the corresponding step definitions look like this (where IsItFriday is the \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo; under test):\npublic class StepDefinitions { private String today; private String actualAnswer; @Given(\u0026#34;today is Sunday\u0026#34;) public void todayIsSunday() { today = \u0026#34;Sunday\u0026#34;; } @When(\u0026#34;I ask whether it\u0026#39;s Friday yet\u0026#34;) public void iAskWhetherItIsFridayYet() { actualAnswer = IsItFriday.isItFriday(today); } @Then(\u0026#34;I should be told {string}\u0026#34;) public void iShouldBeTold(String expectedAnswer) { assertEquals(expectedAnswer, actualAnswer); } } (I am showing annotation-based step definitions here as I personally find them more expressive than the lambda alternatives available as part of cucumber-java8).\nsystem under test (SUT) My real SUT involved multiple kafka-steams components and a number of topics but here we\u0026rsquo;ll use a simplified example with a single kafka-stream that will receive details of orders that have been placed from one topic, enrich them with details of the (existing) customer that placed the order and provide a summary of the order to the sales team via another topic.\nAll messages will be in json.\nproject set-up The build-tool support for using Cucumber with JUnit 5 still has some gaps compared to the support for JUnit 4 (mostly around test discovery in Surefire) but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to start a new project using a older version of JUnit so we\u0026rsquo;ll use JUnit 5 here.\nOur initial project structure will look like this:\npom.xml src test java dev.codecrumbs.sales.test.steps StepDefinitions.java features IntegrationTests.java resources cucumber.properties junit-platform.properties features sales-ingestion.feature A few things to note:\n In the pom, we depend on cucumber-junit-platform-engine \u0026amp; cucumber-java. The former allows us to run Cucumber tests using the JUnit platform1 \u0026amp; the latter contains the annotations used to define test steps. For feature files to be found (by surefire at least), it is necessary to have a class annotated with @Cucumber in the same package. In our case this is named IntegrationTests. cucumber.properties contains settings that customise Cucumber (just output formatting for now) and is used by the Cucumber CLI when executing tests from your IDE. junit-platform.properties is identical to cucumber.properties but is used by surefire. This duplication is an annoyance I have yet to resolve.  first feature sales-ingestion.feature looks like this:\nFeature:Sales are ingested. Scenario:Details of a sale are ingested. Scenario Outline: Given An existing customer \u0026#34;\u0026lt;customer\u0026gt;\u0026#34; exists. When Order \u0026#34;\u0026lt;order\u0026gt;\u0026#34; is placed. Then The Sales Team are notified of Order \u0026#34;\u0026lt;summary\u0026gt;\u0026#34;. Scenarios: | customer| order| summary||john-smith|five-apples|john-smiths-apples| We have a single parameterized scenario that allows us to execute the same test multiple times with different inputs \u0026amp; expected outputs. These appear in the Scenarios table. As our inputs \u0026amp; expected outputs will be json, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to clutter my features with inline json so intend to have customer, order and summary refer to external files.\nthe step definitions public class StepDefinitions { private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(StepDefinitions.class); @Given(\u0026#34;An existing customer {string} exists.\u0026#34;) public void anExistingCustomer(String existingCustomer) { LOG.info(\u0026#34;Loading existing customer {}\u0026#34;, existingCustomer); } @When(\u0026#34;Order {string} is placed.\u0026#34;) public void orderIsReceived(String order) { LOG.info(\u0026#34;Injecting order {}\u0026#34;, order); } @Then(\u0026#34;The Sales Team are notified of Order {string}.\u0026#34;) public void salesTeamAreNotifiedOfOrder(String orderSummary) { LOG.info( \u0026#34;Verifying that order summary {} is received by sales team.\u0026#34;, orderSummary ); } } These step definitions will interact with the system-under test but, for now, we are just logging that the step was executed.\nrunning our tests The tests should now run as part of the maven build and from our IDE and look something like this:\n[INFO] Running Sales are ingested. Scenario: Details of a sale are ingested. # features/sales-ingestion.feature:2 Scenario Outline: # features/sales-ingestion.feature:9 Given An existing customer \u0026#34;john-smith\u0026#34; exists. # dev.codecrumbs.sales.test.steps.StepDefinitions.anExistingCustomer(java.lang.String) When Order \u0026#34;five-apples\u0026#34; is placed. # dev.codecrumbs.sales.test.steps.StepDefinitions.orderIsReceived(java.lang.String) Then The Sales Team are notified of Order \u0026#34;john-smiths-apples\u0026#34;. # dev.codecrumbs.sales.test.steps.StepDefinitions.salesTeamAreNotifiedOfOrder(java.lang.String) Next time we\u0026rsquo;ll extend this to start Kafka using Testcontainers.\nCucumber.\nCucumber-JVM.\nSource2.\n  If you weren\u0026rsquo;t aware, as of version 5, JUnit has been split into a platform \u0026amp; engines for running different kinds of tests. You may be familiar with Jupiter (containing the annotations \u0026amp; support for running Java unit tests) \u0026amp; Vintage (for running JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit 5 platform). Cucumber works with JUnit 5 by providing its own engine too. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The repository is tagged at 1.0 to indicate the version of it that goes with this part of the series. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://www.codecrumbs.dev/posts/cucumber-part1/","summary":"I recently wrote an integration test framework for a Kafka pipeline using Cucumber and Testcontainers.

Logging ends up inconsistent in its level of detail, format \u0026amp; log level.\nThe logging of the same event could end up like any of the following:\n1: Saving order... 2: Creating order for customer [123] for [5] items with value [Â£56.20]... 3: Adding order [ customer: { ... // full details of customer }, items: { ... // full details of all items }, ... ] In this environment, diagnosing the cause of production issues frequently involves tweaking the log level for certain packages in the hope that the application gives up its secrets and deploying patches with additional log statements when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIt seems clear that we do care about logging \u0026amp; it is an important part of what we deliver.\nIf we are using AOP to consistently apply logging at the boundary to certain layers and have no other logging, that\u0026rsquo;s great. Testing those log statements is probably less valuable. If not, we need a solution.\nLogCaptor LogCaptor is a simple library that allows us to capture logging from the system under test and make assertions about it. It looks like this:\nclass WidgetServiceTest { private final LogCaptor logCaptor = LogCaptor.forClass(WidgetService.class); ... @Test void testAdd() { String name = \u0026#34;My Widget\u0026#34;; service.add(Widget.of(name)); assertThat(logCaptor.getDebugLogs()) .containsExactly( String.format(\u0026#34;Adding widget with name [%s]\u0026#34;, name) ); } } (this example is also using the awesome AssertJ)\nThe LogCaptor class provides methods for getting the logged messages as a list of LogEvent or strings. For the latter, these can be restricted to a particular logging level.\nThe full LogEvent is useful for more complex assertions. It provides access to arguments and any Throwable as well as the message \u0026amp; log level. The following example shows a test of a log statement that includes an exception.\n@Test void testRemoveWithIllegalId() { int illegalId = -1; assertThatIllegalArgumentException() .isThrownBy(() -\u0026gt; service.remove(illegalId)); List\u0026lt;LogEvent\u0026gt; logEvents = logCaptor.getLogEvents(); assertThat(logEvents) .hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying( event -\u0026gt; { assertThat(event.getMessage()) .isEqualTo(\u0026#34;Error removing widget\u0026#34;); assertThat(event.getLevel()) .isEqualTo(\u0026#34;ERROR\u0026#34;); assertThat(event.getThrowable()) .isPresent() .get(as(InstanceOfAssertFactories.THROWABLE)) .hasMessage( String.format( \u0026#34;Widget id must be greater than 0 but was [%s]\u0026#34;, illegalId ) ) .isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class); } ); } It works with all common logging libraries and with the Lombok logging annotations.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s LogCaptor.\nLogCaptor.\nAssertJ.\nSource.\n","permalink":"https://www.codecrumbs.dev/posts/testing-logging/","summary":"I have yet to work on a project where we have attempted to test the log statements in the software \u0026amp; I\u0026rsquo;ve recently found myself asking why.\nLog statements added by different developers (sometimes guided by a woolly statement on logging in the project coding guidelines) vary in their number, style \u0026amp; usefulness.
