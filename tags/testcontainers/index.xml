This is part 2 of a series explaining how, in which we&amp;rsquo;ll start Kafka using the Testcontainers library.

I&amp;rsquo;ll cover Testcontainers more fully in a separate post some time but, for now, we just need to know that Testcontainers is a rather amazing library for starting infrastructure such as databases or messaging systems in Docker containers at test-time.</description></item></channel></rss>
