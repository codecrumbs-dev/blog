This is part 2 of a series explaining how, in which we&amp;rsquo;ll start Kafka using the Testcontainers library.
Part 1 is here if you want to see how to set up Cucumber to run tests from Maven &amp;amp; your IDE.
what is testcontainers? I&amp;rsquo;ll cover Testcontainers more fully in a separate post some time but, for now, we just need to know that Testcontainers is a rather amazing library for starting infrastructure such as databases or messaging systems in Docker containers at test-time.</description></item><item><title>cucumber set up</title><link>https://www.codecrumbs.dev/posts/cucumber-part1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 09:30:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codecrumbs.dev/posts/cucumber-part1/</guid><description>I recently wrote an integration test framework for a Kafka pipeline using Cucumber and Testcontainers. This is part 1 of a series explaining how, starting with setting up our project to be able to run Cucumber tests from maven &amp;amp; our IDE (IntelliJ in my case).
why cucumber? I&amp;rsquo;d previously written a couple of integration test frameworks triggered from JUnit @Test methods. These both used fluent APIs to set up the required environment &amp;amp; execute the test, hiding the plumbing from the test author.</description></item></channel></rss>
